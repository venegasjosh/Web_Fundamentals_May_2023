 - My lecture code
 - Use the code we help you with if you ask for help during the exam

## Why you shouldn't plagiarise:

- Coding Dojo's rules:
    - You will be expled for plagiarising on your exam
    - You will get an Academic Probation if you plagiarise on your assignments
- In the industry:
    - Lawsuits
    - You won't be able to prove to yourself you can code, or to your employer



### General Tips and Advice

- Get Sleep
- Take smalls breaks from your computer
- Everything you need to know for your exam, has been in your assignments and in the learn platform

    - The exam is just an assignment with a time limit
- Don't forget to ask for help
- Setup your project folder ahead of time!!!
- Make sure your files are properly named and connected
- Redoing your core assigments is a good way to practice
